# Frontend API Guide — LASRERA updates (Developers, Market Place, Request To Market, Transaction fees, Onboarding)

This document is for **frontend developers and Cursor agents** working on the frontend codebase. It describes how to consume the backend APIs for:

- **Developers** (new user type) and **Landlords** (Landowners)
- **LASRERA Market Place** (list and publish properties)
- **Request To Market** (Agent requests; Publisher accepts/rejects)
- **Inspection flow** (buyer requests; Agent/Developer accepts or rejects; optional inspection fee ₦1,000–₦50,000 and payment link — see **Section 8**)
- **Transaction registration fee by price** (₦100k / ₦150k bands)
- **Onboarding**: Registration, email verification, login, social sign-up/login
- **AI-assisted form filling**: Optional OpenAI-powered suggestions for **property** and **preference** forms (see **Section 10**)

Use your configured **API base URL** https://khabiteq-realty.onrender.com/api as the prefix for all paths below. Paths are relative to that base.

---

## 1. Onboarding (Landlords and Developers)

Landlords (user type **Landowners**) and **Developers** use the same auth flows as Agents. No separate onboarding product; the backend treats them as account types via `userType`.

### 1.1 Registration (email/password)

**Endpoint:** `POST /auth/register`  
**Auth:** None (public).

**Request body (JSON):**

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description |
|--------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| firstName    | string | Yes      | |
| lastName     | string | Yes      | |
| email        | string | Yes      | Valid email. |
| password     | string | Yes      | Min 6 characters. |
| **userType** | string | Yes      | One of: `"Landowners"`, `"Agent"`, `"FieldAgent"`, `"Developer"`. Use `"Landowners"` for Landlord, `"Developer"` for Developer. |
| phoneNumber  | string | Yes      | |
| address      | string \| object | Yes | |
| referralCode | string | No       | Optional. |

**Success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account created successfully. Please verify your email."
}
```

**Notes:**

- Backend sends a verification email. User must open the link to verify.
- After verification, user can log in; no extra admin approval for Landowners or Developers.

---

### 1.2 Email verification

User clicks the link in the email. The link targets the **frontend** (e.g. `{CLIENT_LINK}/auth/verify-account?token=...`). The frontend should call:

**Endpoint:** `GET /auth/verifyAccount?token={token}`  
**Auth:** None (public).  
**Query:** `token` — verification token from the email link.

**Success response (200):**

Returns login-style payload (token + user). Example shape:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email verified successfully!",
  "data": {
    "token": "<JWT>",
    "user": {
      "id": "...",
      "firstName": "...",
      "lastName": "...",
      "email": "...",
      "phoneNumber": "...",
      "userType": "Landowners" | "Agent" | "FieldAgent" | "Developer",
      "isAccountVerified": true,
      "accountApproved": false,
      "accountStatus": "active",
      "address": "...",
      "profile_picture": "...",
      "accountId": "...",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

For **Developer**, the backend may include `dealSite` and `activeSubscription` in `user` (same pattern as Agent) when implemented on the verify response. For **Agent**, `user` may include `agentData`, `isAccountApproved`, and optionally `dealSite`/`activeSubscription` depending on implementation.

**Error (400):** Token missing, invalid, or expired.

---

### 1.3 Login (email/password)

**Endpoint:** `POST /auth/login`  
**Auth:** None (public).

**Request body (JSON):**

| Field    | Type   | Required | Description |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| email    | string | Yes      | |
| password | string | Yes      | |

**Success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "token": "<JWT>",
    "user": {
      "id": "...",
      "firstName": "...",
      "lastName": "...",
      "email": "...",
      "phoneNumber": "...",
      "userType": "Landowners" | "Agent" | "FieldAgent" | "Developer",
      "isAccountVerified": true,
      "accountApproved": false,
      "accountStatus": "active",
      "address": "...",
      "profile_picture": "...",
      "accountId": "...",
      "isAccountApproved": false,
      "activeSubscription": { ... } | null,
      "dealSite": { ... } | null
    }
  }
}
```

**Developer-specific:** When `userType === "Developer"`, `user` includes:

- `activeSubscription` — same shape as Agent (subscription snapshot with features); `null` if none.
- `dealSite` — same shape as Agent (public page details); `null` if not created.

Use these to show public page and subscription state (e.g. show DealSite link, prompt to subscribe if needed).

**Agent-specific:** When `userType === "Agent"`, `user` may include `agentData`, `isAccountApproved`, `activeSubscription`, `dealSite`.

**Errors:**

- 403 — Email not verified: backend may resend verification email; message indicates this.
- 403 — Account inactive or deleted.

---

### 1.4 Social sign-up / login (Google)

**Endpoint:** `POST /auth/googleAuth`  
**Auth:** None (public).

**Request body (JSON):**

| Field        | Type   | Required | Description |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| idToken     | string | Yes      | Google ID token. |
| userType    | string | No*      | *Required for **new** users. One of: `"Landowners"`, `"Agent"`, `"Developer"`. |
| referralCode| string | No       | Optional. |

If the email is not found, backend creates a new user; **for new users `userType` must be sent** so the account is created as Landowner, Agent, or Developer. For existing users, `userType` is ignored.

**Success response (200):** Same shape as login: `data.token`, `data.user` (with `userType`, and for Developer: `activeSubscription`, `dealSite`).

**Error (404):** Account not found and `userType` not provided — message: *"Account not found. If you are a new user, please register first, specifying your account type (Landowners, Agent, or Developer)."*

---

### 1.5 Social sign-up / login (Facebook)

**Endpoint:** `POST /auth/facebookAuth`  
**Auth:** None (public).

**Request body (JSON):** Same as Google: `idToken` (Facebook access token), optional `userType` (required for new users), optional `referralCode`.  
**Success / errors:** Same idea as Google (login payload or 404 if new user without `userType`).

---

### 1.6 Other auth-related routes (same as before)

- Resend verification: `POST /auth/resendVerificationToken` (body as required by backend).
- Reset password request: `POST /auth/resetPasswordRequest`
- Verify reset code: `POST /auth/verifyPasswordResetCode`
- Reset password: `POST /auth/resetPassword`

---

## 2. User types and capabilities

| userType     | Can set listingScope to lasrera_marketplace | Can use "Request To Market" (as requester) | DealSite / subscription |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Landowners  | Yes                                          | No (can be Publisher)                       | No                       |
| Developer   | Yes                                          | No (can be Publisher)                       | Yes (same as Agent)      |
| Agent       | No (forced to agent_listing)                 | Yes                                         | Yes                      |
| FieldAgent  | No                                           | No                                          | No                       |

- **Landowners** and **Developer** can **publish to LASRERA Market Place** by creating/editing a property with `listingScope: "lasrera_marketplace"`.
- **Agents** can **request to market** a marketplace property (see Request To Market below).
- **Developers** get `dealSite` and `activeSubscription` in login (and optionally verify) response; subscription is required to create/maintain DealSite and to post properties (same as Agent).

---

## 3. LASRERA Market Place

### 3.1 List marketplace properties (public)

**Endpoint:** `GET /lasrera-marketplace/properties`  
**Auth:** None (public).

**Query parameters:**

| Param    | Type   | Required | Description |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| page     | string | No       | Default `1`. |
| limit    | string | No       | Default `20`, max 100. |
| briefType| string | No       | Filter by brief type. |
| state    | string | No       | Filter by location state (regex). |
| minPrice | string | No       | Min price (number as string). |
| maxPrice | string | No       | Max price (number as string). |

**Success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "LASRERA Market Place properties. Contact is not shown; use 'Request To Market' (Agents only).",
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "propertyType": "...",
      "propertyCategory": "...",
      "price": 1234567,
      "location": { ... },
      "additionalFeatures": { ... },
      "pictures": [ ... ],
      "briefType": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "createdAt": "..."
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 100,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "totalPages": 5
  }
}
```

**Note:** Contact details of landlord/developer are **not** returned. Each listing should show a **"Request To Market"** button; only **Agents** (authenticated) can call the create request API.

---

### 3.2 Publish property to LASRERA Market Place (Landlord / Developer)

Use the **existing account property create/update** API. Ensure the user is authenticated (Bearer token) and is **Landowners** or **Developer**.

**Create property:** `POST /account/properties/create`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (account auth).

Include in the request body:

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description |
|---------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| listingScope  | string | No       | Use `"lasrera_marketplace"` to publish only to LASRERA Market Place. Default `"agent_listing"`. Only **Landowners** and **Developer** can set `"lasrera_marketplace"`; Agents are forced to `agent_listing`. |

Plus all other required property fields (propertyType, propertyCategory, price, location, etc.) as per existing property schema.

**Edit property:** `PATCH /account/properties/:propertyId/edit` — same rules; only Landowners/Developer can set or keep `listingScope: "lasrera_marketplace"`.

---

## 4. Request To Market

Only **Agents** can create a request. **Publishers** (Landlord or Developer who own the property) accept or reject.

### 4.1 Create request (Agent only)

**Endpoint:** `POST /account/request-to-market`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (Agent).

**Request body (JSON):**

| Field      | Type   | Required | Description |
|------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| propertyId | string | Yes      | Property `_id` (must be a LASRERA Market Place property). |

**Success response (201):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Request to market submitted. The publisher will be notified to accept or reject.",
  "data": {
    "requestId": "...",
    "propertyId": "...",
    "status": "pending",
    "agentCommissionAmount": 50000
  }
}
```

**Errors:**

- 403 — Only Agents can request.
- 400 — propertyId missing; or property not marketplace; or property not owned by Landlord/Developer.
- 409 — Already a pending request for this property by this agent.

---

### 4.2 List requests (Agent or Publisher)

**Endpoint:** `GET /account/request-to-market`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (Agent, Landowners, or Developer).

**Query parameters:**

| Param  | Type   | Required | Description |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| role   | string | No       | `agent` — my requests; `publisher` — requests for my properties. If omitted, backend infers from userType (Agent → agent, Landowners/Developer → publisher). |
| status | string | No       | Filter: `pending`, `accepted`, `rejected`. |
| page   | string | No       | Default `1`. |
| limit  | string | No       | Default `20`, max 100. |

**Success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "propertyId": { "_id": "...", "location": {...}, "price": ..., "briefType": "...", "pictures": [...], "listingScope": "...", "agentCommissionAmount": ... },
      "requestedByAgentId": { "firstName": "...", "lastName": "...", "fullName": "...", "email": "..." },
      "publisherId": { "firstName": "...", "lastName": "...", "fullName": "...", "email": "..." },
      "status": "pending" | "accepted" | "rejected",
      "agentCommissionAmount": 50000,
      "rejectedReason": "...",
      "acceptedAt": "...",
      "rejectedAt": "...",
      "createdAt": "..."
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 10,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

---

### 4.3 Respond to request (Publisher only)

**Endpoint:** `POST /account/request-to-market/:requestId/respond`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (must be the Publisher of the property).

**Request body (JSON):**

| Field          | Type   | Required | Description |
|----------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| action         | string | Yes      | `"accept"` or `"reject"`. |
| rejectedReason | string | No       | Optional; use when `action === "reject"`. |

**Success response (200) — reject:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Request rejected. The agent has been notified.",
  "data": { "status": "rejected" }
}
```

**Success response (200) — accept:**

No payment link is generated at accept time. The Publisher receives an email explaining that agent commission is based on the **actual sale price** and must be registered on the dashboard after the transaction is complete.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Request accepted. The property is now visible on the agent's public page. After the transaction is complete, register the actual sale price on your dashboard to calculate and pay the agent commission.",
  "data": {
    "status": "accepted",
    "propertyId": "..."
  }
}
```

To record the sale and optional proof of payment to the Agent, the Publisher must later call **`POST /account/request-to-market/:requestId/register-sale`** (see 4.3.1) with the actual sale price, commission percentage, and optionally a receipt URL. Payment to the Agent happens outside the app.

**Errors:**

- 403 — Only the property publisher can respond.
- 400 — Request already responded to; or invalid `action`.

---

### 4.3.1 Register sale (Publisher only) — no in-app payment link

After the Publisher has accepted a request and the property is sold, they register the **actual sale price** and (for Developer) the **commission percentage**. The backend computes the agent commission. **Payment to the Agent is made outside the app** (e.g. bank transfer, cash); the Publisher may optionally upload a **receipt** (proof of payment) so that admin can verify the developer/landlord has paid the Agent.

**Endpoint:** `POST /account/request-to-market/:requestId/register-sale`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (must be the Publisher of the property).

**Request body (JSON):**

| Field                  | Type   | Required | Description |
|------------------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| actualSalePriceNaira   | number | Yes      | Actual price in Naira at which the property was sold. |
| commissionPercent      | number | For Developer only | Commission percentage (1–5). **Landlord:** always 5% (omit or ignored). **Developer:** required, 1–5. |
| commissionReceiptUrl   | string | No       | Optional. URL of uploaded receipt/proof of payment (e.g. from your upload endpoint). Used for admin verification that the Publisher paid the Agent. |

**Receipt upload flow:** If the frontend supports receipt upload, first call your file upload endpoint (e.g. `POST /upload-single-file` with `file` and optionally `for: "default"` or a dedicated type), then send the returned URL in **`commissionReceiptUrl`** when calling register-sale.

**Success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Sale registered. Pay the agent commission outside the app; receipt URL saved for admin verification when provided.",
  "data": {
    "agentCommissionAmount": 4000000,
    "commissionPercent": 5,
    "actualSalePriceNaira": 80000000,
    "commissionReceiptUrl": "https://...",
    "agent": {
      "name": "Agent Name",
      "email": "agent@example.com",
      "phoneNumber": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

- **agentCommissionAmount** — Computed as `actualSalePriceNaira × (commissionPercent / 100)` (e.g. 5% of ₦80,000,000 = ₦4,000,000). Show this to the Publisher so they know how much to pay the Agent.
- **agent** — Agent details (name, email, phoneNumber) so the Publisher can pay the Agent outside the app.
- **commissionReceiptUrl** — Echo of the saved receipt URL when provided; otherwise `null`. Admin can retrieve this from the request-to-market list to confirm payment.

**Errors:**

- 400 — `actualSalePriceNaira` missing/invalid; or (Developer) `commissionPercent` missing or not 1–5; or sale already registered for this request.
- 403 — Only the property publisher can register the sale.
- 404 — Request not found.

---

### 4.4 Publisher (Landlord/Developer) dashboard: list requests, Accept/Reject, Register sale, and payment

The endpoint that returns Request To Market data to the **Publisher (Developer or Landlord)** includes **Agent details** for each request so the frontend can show the Agent and attach a **“Register sale”** button for accepted requests. Implement the flow below with the exact APIs listed.

---

#### API 1: List requests (Publisher view — includes Agent details)

**Method and URL:** `GET /account/request-to-market?role=publisher&status={pending|accepted|rejected}`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (account auth). User must be Landlord or Developer (Publisher).

**Query params:**

| Param   | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| role    | Yes (for Publisher view) | `publisher` |
| status  | No       | `pending` \| `accepted` \| `rejected`. Omit to return all. |
| page    | No       | Default `1` |
| limit   | No       | Default `20` |

**Success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "requestId",
      "status": "pending",
      "propertyId": { "location": {...}, "price": 50000000, "briefType": "sell", "pictures": [], ... },
      "requestedByAgentId": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "fullName": "John Doe",
        "email": "agent@example.com",
        "phoneNumber": "+234..."
      },
      "agentCommissionAmount": 0,
      "publisherId": {...},
      "acceptedAt": null,
      "actualSalePriceNaira": null,
      "commissionPercent": null,
      "saleRegisteredAt": null
    }
  ],
  "pagination": { "total": 10, "page": 1, "limit": 20, "totalPages": 1 }
}
```

**Fields to use on the frontend:**

- **`_id`** — Request ID. Use as `requestId` in respond and register-sale APIs.
- **`status`** — `"pending"` \| `"accepted"` \| `"rejected"`.
- **`propertyId`** — Property summary (location, price, briefType, pictures, etc.) for display.
- **`requestedByAgentId`** — **Agent details** (firstName, lastName, fullName, email, phoneNumber). Show Agent name and contact on each request card/row.
- **`agentCommissionAmount`** — From listing (may be 0); commission at pay time is based on actual sale (see Register sale).
- **`saleRegisteredAt`** — If set, sale is already registered for this request; show "Sale registered" instead of "Register sale".
- **`commissionReceiptUrl`** — When present (after register sale with receipt), the URL of the uploaded receipt. **Admin** can use this (e.g. when listing requests) to confirm the Publisher has paid the Agent.

**UI:** For each request, show property summary + **Agent details** (name, email, phone). For **pending**: show **Accept** and **Reject**. For **accepted** and not yet registered: show **“Register sale”** (see Step 3).

---

#### API 2: Accept or Reject a request

**Accept**  
**Method and URL:** `POST /account/request-to-market/:requestId/respond`  
**Body:** `{ "action": "accept" }`  
Use the request’s **`_id`** as **`requestId`** in the URL.

**Reject**  
**Method and URL:** `POST /account/request-to-market/:requestId/respond`  
**Body:** `{ "action": "reject", "rejectedReason": "optional reason" }`  
Same **`requestId`**.

**Success (200) — accept:** No payment link. Message tells Publisher to register actual sale after transaction.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Request accepted. The property is now visible on the agent's public page. After the transaction is complete, register the actual sale price on your dashboard to calculate and pay the agent commission.",
  "data": { "status": "accepted", "propertyId": "..." }
}
```

**UI:** “Accept” / “Reject” on each row/card; on success, refresh the list or update that request’s status.

---

#### Step 3: “Register sale” button and modal (accepted requests only)

When the property is sold, the Publisher registers the actual sale in the app. **No payment link is generated** — payment to the Agent happens outside the app (e.g. bank transfer). The Publisher may optionally upload a **receipt** (proof of payment) so admin can verify the Agent was paid. The **list response already includes Agent details** and request `_id`, so the frontend can attach a **“Register sale”** action per **accepted** request (and hide it if `saleRegisteredAt` is set).

**UI flow:**

1. For each **accepted** request with **no** `saleRegisteredAt`, show a **“Register sale”** button (same row/card as the request, with Agent details).
2. **On click:** open a **modal** (sale registration form).
3. **Form fields:**
   - **Actual sale price (Naira)** — number, required. Label e.g. “Actual price at which the property was sold (₦)”.
   - **Commission %** — only if user is **Developer**: number 1–5, required. If user is **Landlord**, do not show this field (backend uses 5%).
   - **Receipt (proof of payment)** — optional. File upload; after upload use the returned URL as `commissionReceiptUrl` in API 3. Lets admin confirm the Publisher has paid the Agent.
4. **Modal actions:** “Cancel” (close modal), **“Submit”** (submit registration).
5. **On Submit:** call **API 3** with the form values and the request’s `_id`.
6. **On success:** close modal and show that the sale was registered. Optionally show **Agent details** and **commission amount** so the Publisher knows who to pay and how much (payment is done outside the app).

---

#### API 3: Register sale (no payment link; optional receipt)

**Method and URL:** `POST /account/request-to-market/:requestId/register-sale`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (Publisher).  
Use the request’s **`_id`** as **`requestId`** in the URL.

**Request body (JSON):**

| Field                | Type   | Required | Description |
|----------------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| actualSalePriceNaira | number | Yes      | Actual price in Naira at which the property was sold. |
| commissionPercent    | number | Developer only | 1–5. **Landlord:** omit (backend uses 5%). |
| commissionReceiptUrl | string | No             | Optional. URL from upload endpoint (receipt/proof of payment). Visible to admin. |

**Success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Sale registered. Pay the agent commission outside the app; receipt URL saved for admin verification when provided.",
  "data": {
    "agentCommissionAmount": 4000000,
    "commissionPercent": 5,
    "actualSalePriceNaira": 80000000,
    "commissionReceiptUrl": "https://...",
    "agent": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "agent@example.com",
      "phoneNumber": "+234..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Frontend handling:**

- No **paymentUrl** is returned. Payment to the Agent is done **outside the app** (e.g. bank transfer).
- Show **`data.agentCommissionAmount`** and **`data.agent`** (name, email, phoneNumber) so the Publisher knows how much to pay and who to pay.
- **`commissionReceiptUrl`** is returned when one was submitted; admin can use it (e.g. from the request list) to confirm the Publisher paid the Agent.


**Errors:**

- **400** — `actualSalePriceNaira` missing/invalid; (Developer) `commissionPercent` missing or not 1–5; or sale already registered for this request.
- **403** — Only the property publisher can register the sale.
- **404** — Request not found.

#### Summary: APIs to consume for Publisher Request To Market

| Action            | Method | URL | Body / notes |
|-------------------|--------|-----|--------------|
| List requests     | GET    | `/account/request-to-market?role=publisher&status=pending` (or `accepted` / omit) | Returns requests + **Agent details** (`requestedByAgentId`), `saleRegisteredAt`. |
| Accept request    | POST   | `/account/request-to-market/:requestId/respond` | `{ "action": "accept" }` |
| Reject request    | POST   | `/account/request-to-market/:requestId/respond` | `{ "action": "reject", "rejectedReason": "..." }` |
| Register sale     | POST   | `/account/request-to-market/:requestId/register-sale` | `{ "actualSalePriceNaira": number, "commissionPercent": number, "commissionReceiptUrl": string? }`. No payment link; optional receipt for admin verification. Returns **agent** details and **agentCommissionAmount**. |

### 4.5 Agent: verify property address on map (frontend-only)

Before requesting to market a publisher property, the **Agent** can confirm the property address on a map to ensure it exists and is correct.

**Implementation (current):**

- **Purely frontend.** On the KHABITEQ Market Place page (`/lasrera-marketplace`), each property card shows a **"Verify address on map"** link. Clicking it opens a modal with the property location displayed in an **embedded Google Map** (iframe with `maps.google.com?q=<address>`). No Google Places or Geocoding API key is required for this; the address string (state, LGA, area, street if available) from the listing is passed to the map embed.
- The agent can close the modal or, after confirming the location, click **"Request To Market"** in the same modal to submit the request.

**Optional backend enhancement:**

- If you want **server-side address validation** (e.g. ensure the address resolves to a real place via Google Geocoding API), that would be a **backend** integration: the backend would call the Geocoding API and optionally store normalized coordinates or a validation flag. The frontend would continue to show the map; any "verified" badge or stricter validation would come from the backend response.

---

### 4.6 Public access page (DealSite): ensuring accepted Request To Market properties are visible

When a **Publisher (Landlord or Developer)** accepts an **Agent’s Request To Market**, the backend adds that Agent to the property’s **`marketedByAgentIds`** array (multiple agents can market the same property). The property must then appear on:

1. **The Agent’s public access page (DealSite)** — so visitors see both properties the Agent owns and properties they are marketing (accepted by the Publisher).
2. **The Publisher’s public access page (DealSite), when the marketplace is opened** — those properties are still owned by the Publisher, so they appear under the Publisher’s DealSite as well.

The **public access page application** must use the correct API and query params so that both **owned** and **marketed-by-agent** properties are returned. If the property does not show on the Agent’s DealSite, the usual cause is calling the wrong endpoint or sending a **briefType** (or other) filter that excludes it.

#### API the public access page must use

**Endpoint:** `GET /deal-site/:publicSlug/properties`  
**Auth:** None (public).  
**Base URL:** Your API base (e.g. `https://api.khabiteq.com` or `https://khabiteq-realty.onrender.com/api`). So the full URL is: `{API_BASE}/deal-site/:publicSlug/properties`.

- **`:publicSlug`** — The DealSite’s public slug (e.g. from the page URL when a visitor is on the Agent’s or Publisher’s public page, e.g. `john-doe-properties`).

**What the backend returns:**

- Properties where **owner** = DealSite creator (User who owns the DealSite), **or**
- Properties where **marketedByAgentIds** contains the DealSite creator (Request To Market accepted for this Agent; same property can be marketed by multiple agents).

So a **single** call to this endpoint returns both “my listings” and “properties I’m marketing for others” for that DealSite. No second API is needed.

#### Query parameters (optional)

| Param       | Type   | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| page       | string | Default `1`. |
| limit      | string | Default `10`. |
| briefType  | string | **Only send when the user has chosen a specific type** (e.g. `sell`, `rent`). **Do not send** when showing “All” or on initial load — otherwise the backend filters by that type and marketed properties with a different type can disappear. |
| location   | string | e.g. state, LGA, area (comma-separated). |
| priceRange | string | JSON string, e.g. `{"min":1000000,"max":50000000}`. |
| type       | string | Property category (e.g. Residential, Commercial, Land). |
| bedroom    | string | Number(s). |
| bathroom   | string | Number(s). |
| landSize   | string | Number. |
| documentType | string | Comma-separated. |
| desireFeature | string | Comma-separated. |
| tenantCriteria | string | Comma-separated. |

**Critical for visibility:**

- **Omit `briefType`** (or do not add it to the request) when the page is showing “All” properties. The backend only filters by `briefType` when it is present and non-empty. If the frontend sends `briefType` (e.g. from a dropdown default), marketed properties may be excluded.
- Use the **same** endpoint for both the **Agent’s** public page and the **Publisher’s** public page: only `publicSlug` changes (Agent’s slug vs Publisher’s slug).

#### Success response (200)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "dealSite": { "inspectionSettings": { ... } },
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "propertyId",
      "propertyType": "sell",
      "propertyCategory": "Residential",
      "propertyCondition": "New",
      "price": 50000000,
      "location": { "state": "...", "localGovernment": "...", "area": "..." },
      "additionalFeatures": { "noOfBedroom": 3, ... },
      "pictures": ["..."],
      "isAvailable": true,
      "shortletDetails": null,
      "bookedPeriods": [],
      "status": "active",
      "briefType": "sell",
      "isPremium": false,
      "isApproved": true
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 15,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 2,
    "perPage": 10
  }
}
```

Render the **data** array as the property list. No distinction in the response between “owned” and “marketed”; both are included whenever they match the filters.

#### Single property (detail page)

**Endpoint:** `GET /deal-site/:publicSlug/properties/:propertyId`  
**Auth:** None (public).

Same `publicSlug` as the list. The backend allows access if the property is either owned by the DealSite creator or has the DealSite creator in **marketedByAgentIds** (or legacy **marketedByAgentId**). Use this for the property detail page on the public access site.

#### Summary: how the public access page should handle the APIs

1. **Resolve `publicSlug`** from the current page (e.g. Agent’s or Publisher’s DealSite URL).
2. **List properties:** `GET {API_BASE}/deal-site/:publicSlug/properties` with **no `briefType`** (and no other filters) on initial load or when “All” is selected, so that both owned and marketed properties appear.
3. **Optional filters:** When the user selects a type (e.g. “For Sale”), add `briefType=sell`; when they select location/price/etc., add the corresponding query params. Avoid defaulting `briefType` to a value when you intend to show all.
4. **Detail page:** `GET {API_BASE}/deal-site/:publicSlug/properties/:propertyId` for a single property.
5. **Featured properties:** If the page shows a “Featured” section, use `GET {API_BASE}/deal-site/:publicSlug/featuredProperties`. The backend already includes both owned and marketed properties in featured when applicable.

Following this ensures that when a Publisher accepts an Agent’s Request To Market, the property appears on the Agent’s public access page (and remains visible on the Publisher’s public page when the marketplace is opened).

---

## 5. Transaction registration fee by price

Processing fee for transaction registration is **no longer a percentage**. It is determined only by **transaction/property value** (same bands for all transaction types):

| Property/transaction value | Processing fee (Naira) |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Below ₦5M                  | No fee (0)              |
| ₦5M – ₦50M                 | ₦100,000                |
| Above ₦50M                 | ₦150,000                |

The **register** endpoint returns `data.processingFee` (in Naira). Use it (and optional `data.paymentUrl`) when building the transaction registration UI. No frontend fee calculation is required; the backend uses the value band logic above.

---

## 6. Transaction registration APIs (summary)

These are used by the **public/DealSite** frontend for the transaction registration portal. Base path: **`/transaction-registration`** (relative to API base URL).

### 6.1 Processing fee logic (how the backend determines the fee)

The **processing fee** is determined **only by the transaction value** (in Naira) you send when registering. **Transaction type does not change the fee.** The backend uses a single set of value bands:

| Transaction value (Naira) | Processing fee (Naira) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Below ₦5,000,000**      | **₦0** (no fee)        |
| **₦5,000,000 – ₦50,000,000** | **₦100,000**       |
| **Above ₦50,000,000**    | **₦150,000**           |

- **Do not calculate the fee on the frontend.** Send `transactionValue` in the register request; the backend returns `data.processingFee` in the response.
- When **`data.processingFee` is 0**: no payment is required; `data.paymentUrl` will not be present.
- When **`data.processingFee` > 0**: the backend may return `data.paymentUrl` (Paystack). Show the payment link so the user can pay the processing fee; after successful payment, registration moves to the appropriate status (e.g. pending completion).

### 6.2 Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/transaction-registration/types` | List transaction types with labels, eligibility, regulatory requirements, and **display** value bands (for UI only; actual fee at register time uses the bands in 6.1). |
| GET | `/transaction-registration/guidelines` | Safe transaction guidelines (required docs, commission, ownership, etc.). |
| GET | `/transaction-registration/search` | Search by `address`, or `propertyId`, or both `lat` and `lng`. |
| GET | `/transaction-registration/check?propertyId=...` | Check registration status for a property. |
| GET | `/transaction-registration/egis-validate` | E-GIS validation stub (query: propertyId, address, or lat+lng). |
| POST | `/transaction-registration/register` | Submit registration. Backend computes `processingFee` from `transactionValue` (see 6.1) and returns `data.registrationId`, `data.processingFee`, and when fee > 0 optionally `data.paymentUrl`. |

### 6.3 Register request and response (summary)

**Request body** must include (among other fields):

- **`transactionType`** — slug (e.g. `rental_agreement`, `outright_sale`, `off_plan_purchase`, `joint_venture`).
- **`transactionValue`** — number (Naira). This is the value used to determine `processingFee` (see 6.1).
- **`propertyId`** — property ID.
- **`buyer`** — e.g. `{ email, fullName, phoneNumber }`.
- **`propertyIdentification`** — type, exactAddress, titleNumber, ownerName, lat, lng, surveyPlanRef, ownerConfirmation, etc., as per schema.

Optional: payment receipt fields (e.g. `paymentReceiptFileName`, `paymentReceiptBase64`) when the user has already paid elsewhere.

**Success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "registrationId": "...",
    "processingFee": 100000,
    "paymentUrl": "https://checkout.paystack.com/..."
  }
}
```

- **`processingFee`** — Always present; 0 when transaction value is below ₦5M, otherwise ₦100,000 or ₦150,000 per the table in 6.1.
- **`paymentUrl`** — Present when `processingFee` > 0 and the backend generated a Paystack link. Direct the user to this URL to pay the processing fee.

### 6.4 How the frontend should handle it

1. **Before submit:** Collect `transactionValue` (and all other required fields). You can show the user the **possible** fee ranges from Section 5 (or from `/transaction-registration/types` for display), but do **not** compute the final fee yourself.
2. **On submit:** Send the full register payload including `transactionValue`. Use the response `data.processingFee` and `data.paymentUrl`.
3. **After submit:** If `data.processingFee === 0`, show a success message (no payment step). If `data.processingFee > 0`, show the amount and, if present, a “Pay now” button/link using `data.paymentUrl`; after payment, the backend will update the registration status via webhook.

Full request/response shapes are documented in `docs/UPDATES.md` (Transaction Registration & DealSite API alignment).

---

## 7. DealSite and subscription (Developers / Agents)

- **Developers** can create and manage a **DealSite** (public access page) and have the same **subscription** obligation as Agents (required to create/maintain DealSite and to post properties).
- DealSite and subscription APIs are under **`/account`** (e.g. `/account/dealSite/setUp`, `/account/subscriptions/...`). Same as for Agents; use `user.dealSite` and `user.activeSubscription` from login (and verify) to drive UI (e.g. show DealSite link, subscription status, or prompt to subscribe).

**Public access page (no auth):** To show properties on an Agent’s or Publisher’s DealSite (including properties that appear after a Request To Market is accepted), the frontend must call **`GET /deal-site/:publicSlug/properties`**. Do **not** send **`briefType`** when showing “All” properties, or marketed properties may not appear. See **Section 4.6** for full details and query parameters.

---

## 8. Inspection flow (Agent/Developer & Buyer)

This section describes how the **inspection request** flow works from the frontend’s perspective: how a **buyer** submits a request, how an **Agent or Developer** (property owner) lists and responds to it, and when a **payment link** is sent to the buyer.

### 8.1 Flow overview

| Step | Who | Action |
|------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Buyer | Submits an inspection request (main app or DealSite). |
| 2 | Agent/Developer | Sees the request in “My inspections”, opens it, and **accepts** or **rejects**. |
| 3a | On **accept** | Optionally sets an **inspection fee** (₦1,000–₦50,000). If set, backend creates a Paystack payment link and emails the buyer; buyer pays to confirm. |
| 3b | On **reject** | Buyer is notified (email); no payment. |

Inspections can come from:

- **Main app** — buyer uses `POST /inspections/request-inspection` (see your existing inspection docs).
- **DealSite** — buyer uses `POST /deal-site/:publicSlug/inspections/makeRequest`. No fee is required at request time; the Agent/Developer can set the fee when **accepting**.

The **same respond endpoint** is used for both: `POST /account/my-inspections/:inspectionId/respond`. The backend detects DealSite vs main app from the inspection’s `receiverMode`.

---

### 8.2 Agent/Developer: list and view inspections

**List inspections (paginated)**  
**Endpoint:** `GET /account/my-inspections/fetchAll`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (Agent or Developer; must be the property owner).

**Query parameters (optional):**

| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| page | number | Default `1`. |
| limit | number | Default `10`. |
| status | string | Filter by booking status (e.g. `pending_approval`, `inspection_approved`, `pending_transaction`, `agent_rejected`). |
| inspectionType | string | e.g. `price`, `LOI`. |
| inspectionMode | string | e.g. `in_person`, `virtual`. |
| inspectionStatus | string | e.g. `new`, `accepted`, `rejected`. |
| stage | string | e.g. `inspection`, `negotiation`. |
| propertyId | string | Filter by property ID. |

**Success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "propertyId": { ... },
      "requestedBy": { ... },
      "owner": "...",
      "status": "pending_approval",
      "inspectionDate": "...",
      "inspectionTime": "...",
      "inspectionType": "price",
      "inspectionMode": "in_person",
      "receiverMode": { "type": "dealSite", "dealSiteID": "..." },
      "transaction": null,
      ...
    }
  ],
  "pagination": { "total": 5, "page": 1, "limit": 10, "totalPages": 1 }
}
```

Use `receiverMode.type === "dealSite"` to show a “DealSite” badge or to enable the **optional inspection fee** when accepting (see below).

**Get one inspection**  
**Endpoint:** `GET /account/my-inspections/:inspectionId`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (must be the owner of the inspection’s property).

**Success response (200):** Single inspection object (with populated `propertyId`, `requestedBy`, `transaction`).

**Inspection stats**  
**Endpoint:** `GET /account/my-inspections/stats`  
**Auth:** Bearer token.  
Returns counts (e.g. pending, completed, cancelled) for dashboard widgets.

---

### 8.3 Agent/Developer: respond (accept or reject)

**Endpoint:** `POST /account/my-inspections/:inspectionId/respond`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (Agent or Developer; must be the property owner).  
Only inspections with `status === "pending_approval"` can be responded to.

**Request body (JSON):**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| action | string | Yes | `"accept"` or `"reject"`. |
| note | string | No | Optional message (e.g. shown to buyer on reject). |
| inspectionFee | number | No | **Accept only.** Inspection fee in Naira. Allowed range: **₦1,000 – ₦50,000**. |

**Inspection fee behaviour:**

- **Main-app inspections:** The property may already have an `inspectionFee`. If the owner sends `inspectionFee` in the request body, it **overrides** that value (must still be 1,000–50,000). Payment link is created and sent to the buyer.
- **DealSite inspections:** There is no fee at request time. When **accepting**, the owner can **optionally** send `inspectionFee` (1,000–50,000).  
  - If **inspectionFee is sent and in range** → backend creates a Paystack payment link, saves the transaction on the inspection, and emails the buyer with the payment link.  
  - If **inspectionFee is omitted or out of range** → acceptance only; buyer gets an “accepted” email with no payment link.

**Reject — success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Inspection request rejected. The buyer has been notified.",
  "data": { "status": "agent_rejected" }
}
```

**Accept without payment link (e.g. DealSite accept with no fee) — success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Inspection accepted. The buyer has been notified.",
  "data": { "status": "inspection_approved" }
}
```

**Accept with payment link — success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Inspection accepted. The buyer has been sent a payment link for the inspection fee.",
  "data": {
    "status": "pending_transaction",
    "paymentUrl": "https://checkout.paystack.com/...",
    "inspectionFee": 5000
  }
}
```

**Frontend implementation tips:**

- On the “Respond to inspection” screen, show:
  - **Accept** and **Reject** buttons.
  - For **Accept**, an optional **“Inspection fee (₦)”** input. Validate: number, 1,000–50,000 (or leave empty for “no fee” on DealSite).
- For **DealSite** inspections (`receiverMode.type === "dealSite"`), you can show a short note: “You can optionally set an inspection fee (₦1,000–₦50,000). If set, the buyer will receive a payment link.”
- After a successful accept with `data.paymentUrl`, you can show: “Inspection accepted. A payment link has been sent to the buyer’s email.” Optionally show the link for support/copy.

**Errors:**

- **400** — `action` not `"accept"` or `"reject"`; or inspection not in `pending_approval`; or `inspectionFee` not in 1,000–50,000 when provided.
- **403** — User is not the property owner.
- **404** — Inspection not found.

---

### 8.4 Buyer: submission (DealSite)

**Endpoint:** `POST /deal-site/:publicSlug/inspections/makeRequest`  
**Auth:** None (public).  
**Path:** `publicSlug` = the DealSite’s public slug (e.g. from the DealSite URL).

**Request body (JSON):** Same shape as the main-app inspection request (see validator): `requestedBy` (fullName, phoneNumber, email, optional whatsAppNumber), `inspectionDetails` (inspectionDate, inspectionTime, inspectionMode), and `properties` array with `propertyId`, `inspectionType`, and optional `negotiationPrice` / `letterOfIntention`.

**Success response (200):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Inspection request submitted. The agent will respond shortly.",
  "data": {
    "inspections": [ { "_id": "...", ... } ],
    "warnings": { "<propertyId>": "This property has an active or completed registered transaction." }
  }
}
```

After submission, the buyer receives emails when the Agent/Developer **accepts** (with or without payment link) or **rejects**. If a payment link is sent, the email subject is “Inspection accepted – complete your payment” and contains the Paystack link.

---

### 8.5 Summary for frontend

| Actor | Endpoint | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Buyer (DealSite) | `POST /deal-site/:publicSlug/inspections/makeRequest` | Submit inspection request (no auth). |
| Agent/Developer | `GET /account/my-inspections/fetchAll` | List my inspections (filters: status, etc.). |
| Agent/Developer | `GET /account/my-inspections/:inspectionId` | Get one inspection details. |
| Agent/Developer | `POST /account/my-inspections/:inspectionId/respond` | Accept (optional `inspectionFee` 1000–50000) or Reject. |

- **Accept + inspectionFee in range** → Buyer gets email with **payment link**; response includes `paymentUrl` and `inspectionFee`.
- **Accept + no fee (or fee omitted)** → Buyer gets “accepted” email only; no payment link.

---

## 10. AI-assisted form filling (OpenAI)

Users can **optionally** describe what they want in natural language; the backend uses OpenAI to return **suggested form fields** that the frontend can pre-fill. The user should always be able to review and edit the suggestion before submitting. Submission still goes through the normal property or preference APIs and is validated as usual.

### 10.1 When to use

- **Property form** — When an **Agent**, **Landlord**, or **Developer** is posting a property (or brief), offer a "Describe your property" / "Fill with AI" option. They type or speak (speech-to-text on frontend) a short description; the frontend calls the suggest-property endpoint and merges the returned object into the form.
- **Preference form** — When a **Buyer** (or visitor) is submitting a property preference (buy, rent, shortlet, joint venture), offer a "Describe what you're looking for" / "Fill with AI" option. They describe in natural language; the frontend calls the suggest-preference endpoint and merges the result into the preference form.

### 10.2 Suggest property form (Agent, Landlord, Developer)

**Endpoint:** `POST /account/ai/suggest-property`  
**Auth:** Bearer token (account).  
**Allowed user types:** `Agent`, `Landowners`, `Developer`. Others receive `403 Forbidden`.

**Request body (JSON):** `{ "userInput": "string" }` — natural-language description of the property.

**Note:** The frontend may prepend a short instruction block to `userInput` so the model corrects speech-to-text / typing errors (especially Nigerian locations and property terms) before extraction. The backend should pass the full string to the LLM (or treat the prefix as part of the user message).

**Success response (200):** `{ "success": true, "message": "...", "data": { ... } }`. The `data` object contains suggested fields (e.g. `propertyType`, `propertyCategory`, `location`, `price`, `description`, `features`, etc.). Merge into your form; validation happens on actual submit via `POST /account/properties/create`.

**Errors:** 400 — missing/invalid `userInput`. 403 — user not Agent/Landlord/Developer. 503 — OpenAI not configured.

**Note:** If the backend returns **404 Not Found**, the endpoint is not yet implemented. The frontend shows: *"AI suggestions are not available yet. Please fill in the form manually."* Backend should implement `POST /account/ai/suggest-property` (e.g. under the `/account` router) so "Fill with AI" works.

### 10.3 Suggest preference form (Buyer / Public)

**Endpoint:** `POST /ai/suggest-preference`  
**Auth:** None (public).

**Request body (JSON):** `{ "userInput": "string" }` — natural-language description of what the buyer is looking for.

**Note:** The same optional speech/typing correction prefix as in §10.2 may be prepended to `userInput` before send.

**Success response (200):** `{ "success": true, "message": "...", "data": { ... } }`. The `data` object contains suggested preference fields (e.g. `preferenceType`, `preferenceMode`, `location`, `budget`, `propertyDetails`, `features`). Merge into the preference form; user submits via `POST /preferences/submit`.

**Errors:** 400 — missing/invalid `userInput`. 503 — AI service not configured.

### 10.4 Preference submission and Agent Marketplace visibility

- **Submit:** The frontend submits preferences via `POST /preferences/submit`. On success, the user sees a success modal.
- **Agent Marketplace:** The `/agent-marketplace` page lists buyer preferences for agents. It fetches **only approved preferences** via `GET /preferences/getApprovedForAgent?page=1&limit=12` (with optional `search`, `preferenceMode`, `documentType`, `propertyCondition`).

**Backend instructions (preference approval and matching):**

1. **On `POST /preferences/submit`:** After saving the new preference, the backend should:
   - **Match** the preference against existing **submitted briefs** (property listings) from **Agents**, **Landlords**, or **Developers** (e.g. by `preferenceType`/listing type, location, budget range, property details, and/or features).
   - **Auto-approve** the preference so that it is returned by `GET /preferences/getApprovedForAgent` and appears on the Agent Marketplace for agents to see and respond to.
2. Matching criteria are at the backend’s discretion (e.g. same state/LGA, overlapping budget, same property type). The frontend does not perform matching; it only displays preferences returned as approved and allows agents to submit matching properties via the existing flow.
3. If the backend does not auto-approve, newly submitted preferences will **not** appear on the Agent Marketplace until they are approved by some other process; the frontend success message already states that the preference “will appear for agents once it has been approved.”

### 10.5 Implementation tips

1. **UI** — Add a text area or voice input (browser speech-to-text) and a "Fill with AI" button.
2. **Flow** — Call the endpoint with the user's description; on success, merge `data` into form state (e.g. only empty fields, or show a "Review AI suggestion" step).
3. **Errors** — On 503, keep manual form available; do not block the user. On 400, show the error message.
4. **Backend config** — Backend needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Optional: `OPENAI_MODEL` (default `gpt-4o-mini`).

## 9. Quick reference — base paths and auth

| Area | Base path | Auth |
|------|-----------|------|
| Auth (register, login, verify, social) | `/auth` | None for these endpoints |
| Account (profile, properties, my-inspections, request-to-market, dealSite, subscriptions, **ai/suggest-property**) | `/account` | Bearer token (account) |
| **AI suggest preference** | `/ai/suggest-preference` | None (public) |
| LASRERA Market Place list | `/lasrera-marketplace/properties` | None (optional Bearer for currentUserHasRequested) |
