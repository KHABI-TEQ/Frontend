4. **Progress Feedback**: Real-time progress indicator
5. **Success State**: Upload completion with file preview
6. **URL Storage**: Document URL stored for submission

### API Integration

- **Endpoint**: `POST /upload-image`

- File uploaded immediately upon selection for better UX

## Benefits

2. **Real-time Feedback**: Users see upload progress and completion
3. **Error Prevention**: File validation before upload attempts
4. **Accessibility**: Better keyboard navigation and screen reader support

6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

## Usage

The feature is automatically available for buyers on the secure-buyer-response page when they need to upload LOI documents. The upload component will appear when:

- Buyer is in the LOI negotiation step
- Seller has requested changes to the LOI
- Buyer needs to provide an updated LOI document

The system automatically handles the upload process and provides clear feedback throughout the entire experience.
